Linux-DVB-DVBT 
==============

Linux::DVB::DVBT is a package that provides an object interface to any installed Freeview 
tuner cards fitted to a Linux PC. The package supports initial set up (i.e. frequency scanning),
searching for the latest electronic program guide (EPG), and selectign a channel for recording
the video to disk.

Example scripts have been provided in the package which illustrate the expected use of the package (and
are useable programs in themeselves)

* dvbt-scan

Run this by providing the frequency file (usually stored in /usr/share/dvb/dvb-t). If run as root, this will set up the configuration
files for all users. For example:

   $ dvbt-scan /usr/share/dvb/dvb-t/uk-Oxford

* dvbt-epg

When run, this grabs the latest EPG information and updates a MySql database:

   $ dvbt-epg

* dvbt-record

Specify the channel, the duration, and the output filename to record a channel:

   $ dvbt-record "bbc1" spooks.ts 1:00
   
Note that the duration can be specified as an integer (number of minutes), or in HH:MM format (for hours and minutes)
