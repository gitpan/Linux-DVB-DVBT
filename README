Linux-DVB-DVBT 
==============

Linux::DVB::DVBT is a package that provides an object interface to any installed Freeview 
tuner cards fitted to a Linux PC. The package supports initial set up (i.e. frequency scanning),
searching for the latest electronic program guide (EPG), and selectign a channel for recording
the video to disk.

Example scripts have been provided in the package which illustrate the expected use of the package (and
are useable programs in themeselves)

* dvbt-devices

Shows information about fited DVB-T tuners

* dvbt-scan

Run this by providing the frequency file (usually stored in /usr/share/dvb/dvb-t). If run as root, this will set up the configuration
files for all users. For example:

   $ dvbt-scan /usr/share/dvb/dvb-t/uk-Oxford

* dvbt-epg

When run, this grabs the latest EPG information and updates a MySql database:

   $ dvbt-epg

* dvbt-record

Specify the channel, the duration, and the output filename to record a channel:

   $ dvbt-record "bbc1" spooks.ts 1:00
   
Note that the duration can be specified as an integer (number of minutes), or in HH:MM format (for hours and minutes)

* dvbt-ffrec

Similar to dvbt-record, but pipes the transport stream into ffmpeg and uses that to transcode the data directly into an MPEG file (without
saving the transport stream file).

Specify the channel, the duration, and the output filename to record a channel:

   $ dvbt-ffrec "bbc1" spooks.mpeg 1:00 
   
Note that the duration can be specified as an integer (number of minutes), or in HH:MM format (for hours and minutes)

* dvbt-chans

Use to display the current list of tuned channels. Shows them in logical channel number order.

There is also the facility of checking your config files using the -check option. This ensures that the saved channel settings do have
valid tuning parameters (NOTE: This is mainly to ensure that the config files haven't been corrupted).


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

LARGE FILE SUPPORT

I've added the appropriate compile options to enable the module to be compiled with large file support. These options will be enabled
if your Perl build supports it (set in your config.pm when Perl was installed). Without this, recordings were limited to 2G (approx 2 hours).

If you find you still have problems recording large files, then you can always use dvbt-ffrec (instead of dvbt-record). This gets ffmpeg to
do the work of creating the file (and transcoding it to mpeg format).


DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

use File::Basename ;
use File::Path ;
use File::Spec ;
use POSIX qw(strftime);


DOCUMENTATION

Along with the installed perldoc, you can optionally create the Doxygen HTML files for the C library. 
This will be of little interest to general Perl users of the module, but may be of interest to developers
or those that are trying to debug a problem with the module's interaction with their tuner.

Just run

	make doxygen
	
This will create HTML files in ./doxygen/html, the file ./doxygen/html/index.html is the top-level.

DEBUG

If you have any problems, particularly with scanning, please re-run with debug set to 15 and send me the
log file (see my CPAN email). I'll try to fix the problem as soon as possible.
